# SexSegregation

This repo can be used to reproduce results in [Galezo et al. 2018, "Sexual segregation in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins is driven by female avoidance of males"](https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arx177)

The provided scripts can be used in combination with [datasets published on DRYAD](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m7f9m)

1. Quantifying sex segregation

The script SSAS.R can be used in combination with the DRYAD file *DRYAD SSAS Data.csv* to quantify sex segregation in adult bottlenose dolphins by month, and generate Figure 5 of Galezo et al. 2018

2. Analyzing activity budgets

The script ActivityBudget_LoneAnimals.R can be used in combination with the DRYAD file *DRYAD Activity Budget Lone Adults Data.xlsx* after converting the file to .csv format to compare time spent foraging vs. resting in dolphin males vs. females
